NOTE:'
Following the lecture I leared about variable type and simple calcuation
Also, I learned of comparison operators such as <, >, <=, >=, == 
In simple Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, 
Learned change variable type that put ('typename') in front value where you want to change the type
The most important thing I think is address(&) operator in this lecture
The reason is that variable saved as address and address has strong relation with 'Array' and 'Pointer'
