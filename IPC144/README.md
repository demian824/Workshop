Week1
Topic(s) 
• A Simple C Program implementing standard output 
• Using Visual Studio’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
• Using PuTTy – a client application supporting the Secured Socket Shell network Protocol (SSH) to interact with a Linux server 
• Using WinSCP or FileZilla client application supporting the Secured File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to copy files to a remote Linux server
Week2
Introduction: In this workshop, you will code and execute a C language program that accepts numerical values from the user, stores the values in variables of the appropriate data type, performs calculations on the stored variables (including the modulus operator) and casts from one data type to another. 
Topic(s) 
Computations: Types, A Simple Calculation, Expressions
Week3
Introduction: In this workshop, you will code a C language program that implements simple validation on a series of user input values, and then analyzes the data to provide a statistical summary. 
Topic(s) 
• Computations: Logic (sequence, selection, iteration, flags, nesting)
Week4
Introduction: In this workshop, you will code and execute a C language program that implements a simple validation on a series of user input values that are stored to arrays and later analyzed to produce a variety of summary reports. The program will ask for the user’s monthly income and then ask for the price and priority of a series of items the user would like to purchase in the future. It will store this information and allow the user to view predictions on how long it will take to save enough money to purchase their wish list items. 
Topic(s) 
• Computations: Arrays
Week6
Introduction: In this workshop, you will code and execute a C language program that evaluates the cheapest cat food product based on a simple analysis. Data will be entered for three similar products and then displayed back to the user in a tabular table format. The data will be analyzed and displayed with additional calculated information in the form of a formatted table revealing the analysis. The program concludes with the suggested cheapest product. 
Topic(s) 
• Modularity: Functions and Pointers
